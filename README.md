### How it works? 🤨
As default, CS2 just allows disable collision between players with the same team, but with this plugin, you can disable collision between all players, no matter the team.

### Requeriments 📄
1. CS2 Server 🤡
2. [Metamod 2.X](https://www.sourcemm.net/downloads.php/?branch=master)
3. [Swiftly](https://github.com/swiftly-solution/swiftly/releases/latest)

### Installation 📦
1. Download [latest release](https://github.com/criskkky/sw-noblock/releases/latest).
2. Everything is drag & drop, so i think you can do it.
3. Ready!

### Configuring the plugin 👨🏻‍💻
- Doesn't need additional config ✅

### Todo List 🎯
- Fix [issues](https://github.com/criskkky/sw-noblock/issues) if there's any.
